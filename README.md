In this HTML code:

We added an input field for users to enter a word.
We added a "Check" button that calls the checkPalindrome() JavaScript function when clicked.
The JavaScript function checkPalindrome() checks if the entered word is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. It converts the word to lowercase and then compares it to its reverse to determine if it's a palindrome.
The result of the palindrome check is displayed below the input field.
